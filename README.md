NLP-driven Content Classification towards Fake News and Bully Detection

## Project Description:<br> 
Fake news and cyberbullying are increasing issues in today’s society, and detecting them automatically using several mobile and web applications are challenging due to the limited availability of datasets. Deep learning is an excellent approach to solving this issue because it can process massive amounts of data while reducing human effort. This study talks about the challenges and importance of detecting fake news and bullying, as well as previous work in this area. A hybrid model, which combines supervised and unsupervised learning models, is proposed. A deep learning model based on a Convolutional Neural Network with an attention mechanism is also developed that is capable of handling complex fake news datasets and demonstrates its effectiveness on both fake news and cyberbullying datasets. This paper suggests that the newly developed deep learning model can be used for multi-class problems beyond fake news detection. Overall, this study demonstrates the ability of deep learning to automatically detect fake news and offers an innovative approach to solving this critical issue. The key highlight of this paper is the huge improvement in the accuracy of the Korean dataset that belongs to fake news, which is 18.54 and 24.79, respectively, on mission 1 and 2.
